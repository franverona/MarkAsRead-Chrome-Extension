##Mark As Read for Google Reader
=====================================

This extension allows to mark individual items as read in Google Reader by checking their own checkboxes. Its really
useful to avoid mark as read bulk items and lost some important posts.
   
##How to install it:
-------------------------------------

1. Download CRX file called 'MarkAsRead.crx'
2. Open a new tab
3. Drag your recently downloaded CRX file to the new tab
4. Accept

IMPORTANT: recent versions of Google Chrome don't allow to install extensions as I mentioned above, so try the next
steps in order to install the extension:

1. Download the folder called "Uncompressed"
2. Rename it as "Mark as Read".
3. Open "Extensions" settings in Google Chrome.
4. Click on "Load uncompressed extension...".
5. Select the folder "Mark as Read".

Now you should see a checkbox next to "starred" feature on "List View Mode" into your Google Reader.
